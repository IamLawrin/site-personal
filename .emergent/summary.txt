**User's preferred language**: Romanian. The next agent **MUST** respond in Romanian.

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application has been created with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend connected to a MongoDB database.
- The **frontend** was initially built with mock data and has been fully developed according to the user's requirements, including all pages, admin mode, and UI/UX features like the language switcher and New badges.
- The **backend** has been implemented with all necessary API endpoints for CRUD operations on projects, albums, reviews, and contact messages, including image uploads and user authentication.
- **Integration**: The agent has just finished replacing the mock data implementation in the frontend with live API calls to the backend.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working**: Full-stack integration. The agent implemented a backend API, created a service file (), and updated all relevant frontend pages (, , , ) and contexts () to communicate with the backend instead of using mock data.
- **Status**: IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done**: Y (for backend only). The backend API was successfully tested with .
- **Which testing method agent to use?**: both. The frontend integration needs to be thoroughly tested. Use the  to perform end-to-end tests on all user-facing functionalities (viewing data, admin login, creating/editing/deleting content, image uploads).
- **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1**: **(P0)** Verify full-stack integration.
- **Issue 2**: **(P1)** Complete site internationalization (translation).

**Issues Detail**:
- **Issue 1:**
    - **Description**: The frontend has been connected to the backend, but this integration has not been tested to confirm that data is correctly fetched, displayed, created, updated, and deleted across the entire application.
    - **Attempted fixes**: N/A (This is a verification step, not a fix).
    - **Next debug checklist**:
        1. Use  to perform a full-site test.
        2. Verify login works and admin mode is enabled.
        3. Test CRUD operations on the  page.
        4. Test CRUD operations for albums and images on the  page.
        5. Test adding a new review on the  page.
        6. Test submitting the contact form on the  page.
        7. Check browser console for any network errors and backend logs for any API errors.
    - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: To ensure the application is fully functional with a persistent database, delivering the core requirement of the user.
    - **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    - **Is recurring issue?**: N
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: both
    - **Blocked on other issue**: None

- **Issue 2:**
    - **Description**: The agent implemented a language switcher but missed translating the text inside modal dialogs.
    - **Attempted fixes**: None.
    - **Next debug checklist**:
        1. Identify all modal components: , , , .
        2. Integrate the  hook into these components.
        3. Replace hardcoded Romanian text (e.g., Editează Album, Adaugă Proiect) with calls to the translation context (e.g., ).
        4. Add the corresponding keys and translations to the  object in .
    - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: To fulfill the user's request for complete site translation.
    - **Status**: NOT STARTED
    - **Is recurring issue?**: N
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: frontend
    - **Blocked on other issue**: None

**In progress Task List**:
- **Task 1: Complete Backend Integration**
    - **Where to resume**: The backend has been implemented and tested. The frontend code has been updated to call the backend APIs. The next step is to run end-to-end tests to validate that the frontend and backend are working together correctly.
    - **What will be achieved with this?**: A fully functional, data-persistent portfolio website.
    - **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: both
    - **Blocked on something**: None

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks**:
    - **(P2)** Add social media links (Instagram, LinkedIn, GitHub) to the site. The user mentioned wanting this mai tarziu (later).
- **Future Tasks**:
    - The user mentioned they would handle email sending for the contact form, but might ask for help later.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Frontend Scaffolding (with Mock Data)**:
    - Created a full multi-page React application (, , , , , ).
    - Implemented a complete admin mode with password protection and CRUD interfaces for all content types.
    - Designed and implemented a custom Media page with a slideshow and album grid, as per user's specifications.
    - Implemented a detailed project view page with an image gallery.
    - Integrated a component for drag-and-drop image uploads.
    - Iteratively refined the UI based on user feedback (logo, spacing, border radius).
- **Key Features Implementation**:
    - Added a RO/EN language switcher with persistent state ().
    - Implemented a NOU/NEW badge for content added within the last 7 days (, ).
- **Backend Implementation**:
    - Built a complete FastAPI backend with API endpoints for all resources ().
    - Defined data schemas using Pydantic models ().
    - Implemented secure image upload and storage.
    - Implemented token-based authentication for the admin user.
- **Full-Stack Integration**:

- **Backend**: FastAPI, Pydantic, Motor (async MongoDB driver).
- **Database**: MongoDB.
- **State Management**: React Context (, ) for global state; component-level state (, ) for data fetching and UI logic.
- **Authentication**: JWT token-based authentication handled by the backend. The token is stored in  on the frontend.

**All files of reference**
- : Defines the API contract between frontend and backend.
- : Main backend file, integrates all routes.
- : Contains all API endpoint logic.
- : Centralizes all frontend API calls.
- : Manages authentication state and logic.
- : Manages language state and translations.
- : All page components were updated to use the backend API.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The translation logic in  is basic. While sufficient for now, for more complex needs, a dedicated library like  would be a better choice.
- The  file underwent many small, iterative edits and could be refactored for better readability and component separation.

**key api endpoints**
- : Authenticate admin.
- : Upload an image file.
- :  (all),  (create).
- :  (one),  (update), .
- :  (all),  (create).
- :  (one),  (update), .
- :  (all),  (create).
- :  (create).

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- The project has moved from a mock frontend to a full-stack architecture. The immediate priority is to test this new integration.
- The user is highly engaged and provides specific, detailed feedback. Maintain a collaborative and responsive communication style in Romanian.
- The admin password is hardcoded as  in the backend ().
